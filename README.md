# flavorpodsissue

Flutter project showing issues with flutter_flavorizr and shared_preferences. Project created in order to showcase issues coming from adding "https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences" to project that has flavors for different IPAs and APKs, generated by using "https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_flavorizr". App is run by using the following command with variations based on the Flavor we want to run it:

flutter run --flavor production -t lib/main-production.dart

before adding shared_preferences dependency the project does run smoothly. As soon as the library is added, when executing "flutter pub get" Podfile is generated and "ios" files are changed and at that point the app is not runnable anymore unless I would remove the dependency and revert the changes to the "ios" directory.

## Getting Started

* flutter pub get
* flutter pub run build_runner watch --delete-conflicting-outputs
